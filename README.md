      Records mention the Gopalas and Mahishapalas believed to have been the earliest rulers 
      with their capital at Matatirtha, the south-west corner of the Kathmandu Valley. From 
      the 7th or 8th Century B.C. the Kirantis are said to have ruled the valley. Their famous 
      King Yalumber is even mentioned in the epic, ‘Mahabharat’. Around 300 A.D. the Lichhavis 
      arrived from northern India and overthrew the Kirantis. One of the legacies of the Lichhavis
      is the Changu Narayan Temple near Bhaktapur, a UNESCO World Heritage Site (Culture), which dates 
      back to the 5th Century. In the early 7th Century, Amshuvarma, the first Thakuri king took over 
      the throne from his father-in-law who was a Lichhavi. He married off his daughter Bhrikuti to the 
      famous Tibetan King Tsong Tsen Gampo thus establishing good relations with Tibet. The Lichhavis 
      brought art and architecture to the valley but the golden age of creativity arrived in 1200 A.D 
      with the Mallas.

    </p>
    <p>
      During their 550 year rule, the Mallas built numerous temples and splendid palaces with
       picturesque squares. It was also during their rule that society and the cities became well 
       \organized; religious festivals were introduced and literature, music and art were encouraged. 
       After the death of Yaksha Malla, the valley was divided into three kingdoms: Kathmandu (Kantipur),
        Bhaktapur (Bhadgaon) and Patan (Lalitpur). Around this time, the Nepal as we know it today was 
        divided into about 46 independent principalities. One among these was the kingdom of Gorkha with a 
        Shah ruler. Much of Kathmandu Valley’s history around this time was recorded by Capuchin friars who 
        lived in the valley on their way in and out of Tibet.
  
    </p>
    <p>
      An ambitious Gorkha King named Prithvi Narayan Shah embarked on a conquering mission that led to the 
      defeat of all the kingdoms in the valley (including Kirtipur which was an independent state) by 1769. 
      Instead of annexing the newly acquired states to his kingdom of Gorkha, Prithvi Narayan decided to move 
      his capital to Kathmandu establishing the Shah dynasty which ruled unified Nepal from 1769 to 2008.
  
    </p>
    <p>
      The history of the Gorkha state goes back to 1559 when Dravya Shah established a kingdom in an area
       chiefly inhabited by Magars. During the 17th and early 18thcenturies, Gorkha continued a slow expansion,
        conquering various states while forging alliances with others. Prithvi Narayan dedicated himself at an 
        early age to the conquest of the Kathmandu Valley. Recognizing the threat of the British Raj in India, 
        he dismissed European missionaries from the country and for more than a century, Nepal remained in isolation.</p>
